(a) The algorithm checks through the list to see if it has duplicate entries in it. If it has, it returns true, if not it returns false.
(b) The algorithm is in quadratic time (O(n^2)) because the function checks item i in the list, then j increments through all posible positions in the list to check for duplicates. This means you are checking each item in the list twice.
(c)
(d) The algorithm runs faster because it is only checking each position once.
(e) No. The algorithm is now run in liniar time (O(n)). This is because you are only checking each item in the list once. This would mean that the time only increases reletive to n.
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
